The plots show the sensitivity to CP violation at 3\sigma CL
(\Delta\chi^2=9). Sensitivity to CP violation is defined, for a given
point in the theta13-delta plane, by being able to exclude delta=0 and
delta=\pi at the given confidence level. All plots have been prepared
with GLoBES [1].

Degeneracies and correlations are fully taken into account. For all
setups the appropriate disappearance channels have been included. The
beta beam is lacking muon neutrino disappearance, but the result does
not change if T2K disappearance information is included in the
analysis. In all cases systematics between neutrinos, anti-neutrinos,
appearance and disappearance is uncorrelated. For all setups with a
water Cherenkov detector the systematics applies both to background
and signal, uncorrelated.

The neutrino factory assumes 3.1 10^20 mu^+ decays per year for 10
years and 3.1 10^20 mu^- decays for 10 years. It has one detector with
m=100kt at 3000km and another detector with 30kt at 7000km. The
density errors between the two baselines are uncorrelated. The
systematics are 0.1% on the signal and 20% on the background,
uncorrelated. The detector threshold and the other parameters are
taken from [2] and approximate the results of [3].

The beta beam assumes 5.8 10^18 He decays per year for five years and
2.2 10^18 Ne decays per year for five years. The detector mass is
500kt. The detector description and the glb-file is from [5]. 

The SPL setup is taken from [6], and the detector mass is 500kt.

The T2HK setup is taken from [2] and closely follows the LOI [7]. The
detector mass is 1000kt and it runs with 4MW beam power, 6 years with
anti-neutrinos and 2 years with neutrinos. The systematic error on
both background and signal is 5%.

The oscillation parameters were [7,8]:
dm31=0.0024 eV^2
dm21=0.00079 eV^2
th23=\pi/4
th12=0.578

The input errors are (at 1 sigma):
10% on dm31
10% on th23
10% on th12
 4% on dm21
 5% on rho (unless otherwise stated)
