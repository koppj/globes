**********Version 3.0.1

18/01/2007 JK
        - Updated copyright notices in all code files
        - Included title of new paper in README
        - Removed #include <ltdl.h> from globes.c

**********Version 3.0.2

18/01/2007 MR
        - glb_fluxes.c modified: now contains exact beta beam spectrum
                -> no normalization factor needed any more
        - BBvar_WC.glb and BBvar_TASD.glb modified accordingly
        - T2K.glb now has same @norm as T2HK.glb (matches Table 1, hep-ph/0204352)

**********Version 3.0.4

19/01/2007 PH
        - fixed a bug in the defintions parser of globes.c

**********Version 3.0.5

23/01/2007 JK
        - Added hep-ph number of new paper to README
        - Fixed minor problem which occurred for duplicate channel definitions


**********Version 3.0.6

23/01/2007 PH
	- Added a distcheck-hook which tests the md5-sums file in data 

**********Version 3.0.7

25/01/2007 PH
	- the configury now handles --disable-rpath correctly, which
	is what should be used on Mac OS X. Updated to libool 1.5.22
	and autoconf 2.59.

	- undefined AEDL variables are no longer defaulting to zero
	but to NaN, which ensures that they create an ERROR

25/01/2007 JK
        - Corrected correlated flux normalization in D-Chooz_far.glb
          from 2.0% to 2.8%

**********Version 3.0.8

29/03/2007 JK
        - Corrected a bug in the glb_likelihood: In the calculation
          of the Poisson chi^2, the "true" and fitted rates were
          exchanged. This has a visible effect only for very small
          event rates.

17/04/2007 JK
        - Fixed a small bug in glbDefaultExp, leading to a possible read
          beyond array boundaries of smear_data[0]->bin_center 


**********Version 3.0.9

24/05/2007 PH
	- Fixed BUG#18
