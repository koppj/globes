**********Version 3.0.1

18/01/2007 JK
        - Updated copyright notices in all code files
        - Included title of new paper in README
        - Removed #include <ltdl.h> from globes.c

**********Version 3.0.2

18/01/2007 MR
        - glb_fluxes.c modified: now contains exact beta beam spectrum
                -> no normalization factor needed any more
        - BBvar_WC.glb and BBvar_TASD.glb modified accordingly
        - T2K.glb now has same @norm as T2HK.glb (matches Table 1, hep-ph/0204352)

**********Version 3.0.4

19/01/2007 PH
        - fixed a bug in the defintions parser of globes.c

**********Version 3.0.5

23/01/2007 JK
        - Added hep-ph number of new paper to README
        - Fixed minor problem which occurred for duplicate channel definitions


**********Version 3.0.6

23/01/2007 PH
	- Added a distcheck-hook which tests the md5-sums file in data

**********Version 3.0.7

25/01/2007 PH
	- the configury now handles --disable-rpath correctly, which
	is what should be used on Mac OS X. Updated to libool 1.5.22
	and autoconf 2.59.

	- undefined AEDL variables are no longer defaulting to zero
	but to NaN, which ensures that they create an ERROR

25/01/2007 JK
        - Corrected correlated flux normalization in D-Chooz_far.glb
          from 2.0% to 2.8%

**********Version 3.0.8

29/03/2007 JK
        - Corrected a bug in the glb_likelihood: In the calculation
          of the Poisson chi^2, the "true" and fitted rates were
          exchanged. This has a visible effect only for very small
          event rates.

17/04/2007 JK
        - Fixed a small bug in glbDefaultExp, leading to a possible read
          beyond array boundaries of smear_data[0]->bin_center


**********Version 3.0.9

24/05/2007 PH
	- Fixed BUG#18

**********Version 3.0.10
29/06/2007 JK
        - Fixed another potential problem in glb_likelihood (chi^2 could
          become negative for true_rate=0, fit_rate<0)
        - Fixed problem in glbShiftEnergyScale: for negative shifts, the
          leftmost bin was always set to 0, instead of some interpolation
          between 0 and its original value. This is not a big problem, but
          it leads to glb_likelihood returning 1e200, which can confuse
          the minimizer if it happens in the very first evaluation of chi^2.
        - Added DocPlots.nb to the distribution

**********Version 3.0.11
13/09/2007 JK
        - Removed libstdc++ from Makefile in source directory
 	- Declared fa, fb, fc and fu as long double in
 	  glb_hybrid_bracket to avoid problems with extra floating
 	  point digits on x86 CPUs (in the case of flat directions in
 	  parameter space, comparisons could yield wrong results if
 	  the operands were identical, but one of them was stored in
 	  main memory while the other was retained in the floating
 	  point registers). See also http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/,
 	  entry No. #323.

**********Version 3.0.12
13/02/2008 PH
	- Fixed BUG#19


07/07/2008 JK
        - Fixed bug in glb_fluxes.c: Wrong number of flux bins (501
          instead of 500) had been used in glb_flux_calc. See BUG#20.

**********Version 3.0.13
16/07/08 PH

09/08/2008 JK
        - Removed "inline" keywords from declaration of zhetrd3
          (tentatively fixes BUG#22)

16/11/2009 JK
        - Corrected bug in lexer/parser (possible access to memory
          that flex/bison have already freed)

23/11/2009 JK (only branch wbb-tweaks)
        - If low-pass filter is active and smearing matrix is explicitly
          given, the effect of the filter is now compensated
        - Pre-compute part of rates to speed things up by O(10%)

27/11/2009 JK
        - Fixed bug in BB100/BB100_flux_Ne.dat file: Column for \bar{\nu}_e
          was not zero.

10/01/2010 JK (only branch wbb-tweaks)
        - Implemented experimental simulated annealing algorithm
          (is much too slow to be considered seriously)
        - Modified order of some operations in glb_filtered_probability_matrix_cd
          and glb_set_new_rates to improve speed a little
        - Implemented function glbOptimizeSmearingMatrixInExperiment to
          remove close-to-zero entries from smearing matrices to improve speed

03/02/2010 JK (only branch wbb-tweaks)
        - Introduced function glbGetAEDLVariable

30/03/2010 JK (only branch wbb-tweaks)
        - Fixed bug in Lexer leading to wrong line numbers in error messages
        - Fixed bug in Lexer leading to errors if "//" comments appear
          inside other contexts

13 Apr 2010 JK
        - Fixed bug in glbGetFilterInExperiment -- function returned
          only integer values

22 Apr 2010 JK
        - Regenerated all autoconf/automake, libtool, gnulib stuff using
          the latest versions of these packages:
            aclocal 1.11.1
            automake 1.11.1
            autoconf 2.65
            autoheader 2.65
            libtool 2.65
            gnulib-tool 0.0.3828-6d126
          The procedure is
            - Remove m4/ and lib/ directories
            - Run gnulib-tool --import obstack argp mkstemp
              (to get copy required modules from GNU library to our build tree)
            - Get rpm.m4, swig.m4, swig_perl.m4, gsl.m4 macros and copy
              to m4/
            - Run aclocal -I m4, autoconf, automake, autoheader
              (in this order)

23 Apr 2010 JK
        - Significant modifications to parser. Now accepts line breaks
          anywhere.

          lines

********** This version tagged 3.1.7 ************

25 Sep 2010 JK
        - Implemented a bunch of functions that allow the user to assign
          names to parameters, and then use these names in subsequent calls
          to glbSetOscParamByName, glbGetOscParamByName

26 Sep 2010 JK
        - New function glbGetFilenameOfExperiment
        - Changes to Lexer and parser:
          * New directive $citation
          * Strings (with double quotes '"') may now contain arbitrary characters,
            including line breaks. This was necessary to allow for multi-line
            citation information in glb files.
        - New function glbGetCitationForExperiment

********** This version tagged 3.1.8 ************

08 Oct 2010 JK

        - Standalone globes binary no longer complains if user-defined chi^2
          function is used

11 Oct 2010 JK
        - Rebuilt the autoconf/automake system.
          It is important to use libtoolize -c -f to get copies of dependencies
          rather than just symlinks.

15 Oct 2010 JK
        - Added degfinder and NSI probability engine to distribution

22 Oct 2010 JK
        - Added %option nounistd to glb_lexer.l since getopt.h, included from
          unistd.h, was causing trouble on Macs

03 Nov 2010 JK
        - Degfinder and NSI probability engine removed from distribution
          again; will be made available as separate add-ons

20 Nov 2010 JK
        - New functions glbSetProjectionFlagByName, glbGetProjectionFlagByName

        - GLoBES now accepts flux and cross section files with non-equidistant
          sampling points
        - glb_warning, glb_error, glb_fatal are now more flexible: They now allow
          a printf-like syntax with a format string and a list of optional arguments

8 Dec 2010 JK
        - Fixed small bug in glb_multiex.c (Loop in initialization of energy window
          ran over i=0,n_channels rather than i=0,n_rules. Should be a problem
          only in experiments with more rules than channels (I've never seen one).

26 Jan 2011 JK
        - Enclosed #include config.h in %top{ } block in glb_lexer.l to fix
          another Mac compilation problems. I think Apple should pay
          me for the time I spend getting software to run on their system ;-)

********** This version tagged 3.1.10 ************

13 feb 2011 JK
        - Fixed Lexer problem with one-line comments ("//") that led to incorrect
          line counting
        - No error message if $emin or $sampling_min is zero

18 Feb 2011 JK
        - Fixed another small bug in the lexer - occasional syntax error when
          encountering empty "//" comments

21 Feb 2011 JK
        - One more problem with the line counting in the lexer fixed

4 Jan 2012 JK
        - First implementation of new multi-experiment systematics:

          (child did not inherit the current value of the parameter properly)

********** This version tagged 3.2.2 ************

8 May 2012 JK
        - (in branch newsys) A warning is now given if a rule with non-trivial
          systematics treatment is inherited from the parent experiment

********** This version tagged 3.2.3 ************

11 May 2012 JK
        - Increased max. number of channels, rules, etc. to 256

********** This version tagged 3.2.4 ************

11 May 2012 JK
        - #DETECTOR# directive no longer copies rules - caused a lot of confusion
        - Overloading existing environments should now work (still highly experimental
          though)

********** This version tagged 3.2.5 ************

15 May 2012 JK
        - Went back to max. 64 rules/channels etc. and 128 nuisance params.
          Memory consumption was quite high otherwise

********** This version tagged 3.2.6 ************

17 May 2012 JK
        - Fixed bugs in the parser:
            * sys_on/off_function were not properly overloaded
            * Type DOUBLE_INDEXED_PAIR did not account for > 32 rules
            * Type INT_INDEXED_PAIR was implemented incorrectly (-> removed)

********** This version tagged 3.2.7 ************

21 May 2012 JK
        - Added extra cross-checks to glb_default_smear, checking whether the
          energy ranges in the glb_smear data structure agree with those in the
          glb_experiment structure. Note sure if this is strictly necessary.
        - Fixed a bug in glbInitExpFromParent when copying post-smearing efficiencies

25 May 2012 JK

27 Jun 2012 JK
        - Fixed segfault in glbResetExp which happened when the user provided
          a smearing matrix with an incorrect number of rows. This required
          changes to the routines that create smearing matrices
        - Modified memory management for nuisance parameters (introduced
          reference counter)
        - New function glbCorrelateSys

********** This version tagged 3.2.10 ************

11 Jul 2012 JK
        - Fixed a bug in the treatment of correlated systematics. When
          using glbCorrelateSys, some nuisance parameters got double counted.

********** This version tagged 3.2.11 ************

30 Jan 2013 JK
        - If user defines experiment->probability_user_data, it is used instead
          of the global default.
