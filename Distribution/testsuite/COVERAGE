This note explains how to get 'gcov' to work for testing how much code
is covered by particular tests. 

0) Have look at the man page of gcov

1) Run configure with the right flags since coverage testing doesn't
work with shared libraries. There may be versions of gcc where it
doesn't work either.
	configure --disable-shared --disable-modules --disable-perl

2) Make sure that no shared libraries are available in prefix/lib

3) You need to set both CFLAGS and CPPFLAGS 
	make CFLAGS="-ftest-coverage -fprofile-arcs" \
	CPPFLAGS="-ftest-coverage -fprofile-arcs"

4) 
	make install

5) edit 'run-tests' to take your newly compiled version

6) run 'run-tests'

7) cd into the source directory and run
	gcov libglb_la-XXX.da
where XXX is the name of the pertinent source file

8) have a look at the outputs of 7) and XXX.c.gcov

9) you can remove all the coverage test stuff by
	reset-coverage
in the distribution directory
