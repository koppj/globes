                       GLoBES Testsuite
----------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains some very preliminary scripts that could be
the basis for a GLoBES testsuite. The purpose is to compare the results
of two different GLoBES versions. There are a number of test programs
which are subsequently compiled and called by the script run-tests. After
running each test for two different GLoBES-Versions, the results are
compared using the script glbdiff.pl

The test programs must produce output (sent to stdout) in the following
format
  <Some arbitrary Metadata 1> The data that is to be compared 1
  <Some arbitrary Metadata 2> The data that is to be compared 2
  <Some arbitrary Metadata 3> The data that is to be compared 3
  ...

If you want to add your own test program, add the corresponding information
to Makefile.in and rerun autoconf/automake. DON'T FORGET TO MODIFY THE "BIN=..."
and "OBJ=..." LINES APPROPRIATELY! Otherwise, the old executables will not be
properly removed before recompilation, i.e. the tests are run twice with
the same GLoBES version.

To run the tests, specify the directories of the binaries of the two
GLoBES versions you want to compare in run-tests. The variable TESTS
specifies which tests are to be run.
