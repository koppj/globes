Referencing of data in GLoBES
=============================

GLoBES wouldn't be of much use without having high quality input data.
Much of this input data has been published somewhere and the authors
of those publication would appreciate to be cited by the user
when he/she is using their work. It is solely the user's responsibility 
to make sure that he/she understand where a certain input for GLoBES comes
from and wether additional work has to be cited in addition to the 
GLoBES paper~\cite{globes_paper}. To help this task we provide here the
necessary information for the data which is shiped together with GLoBES.

When using the built-in earth matter profile, the original source is 
reference~\cite{Stacey}.

All files ending with `.dat' or `.glb' in the `data' subdirectory have at 
their beginning a comment field which clearly indicates which works should be
cited when using a certain file. Make sure that dependencies are correctly
tracked, i.e. in some cases files included by other files have to checked
also. One can use the `-v3' option to `globes' to see which files
are included.

It is advisable to use the same style for your own input files, since in
case they are distributed, everbody will know how to correctly reference your
work.
