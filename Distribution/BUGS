BUG#17 Duplicate AEDL groups may not work properly

From: Joachim Kopp
Date: 23.01.07

        If an AEDL group (energy, flux, nuflux, rule, cross) appears
        twice (e.g. empty declaration and later definition), the parser
        might assign the information from the second definition to the
        wrong variables, since the counter for that type of environment
        may already have a different value.
        Possible solution: Use loc_count instead of num_of_XXX in function
        grp_end, file glb_parser.y.
