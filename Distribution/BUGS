BUG#17 Duplicate AEDL groups may not work properly

From: Joachim Kopp
Date: 23.01.07

        If an AEDL group (energy, flux, nuflux, rule, cross) appears
        twice (e.g. empty declaration and later definition), the parser
        might assign the information from the second definition to the
        wrong variables, since the counter for that type of environment
        may already have a different value.
        Possible solution: Use loc_count instead of num_of_XXX in function
        grp_end, file glb_parser.y.

BUG#19 Filenames which are an absolute path are not resolved by glb_fopen

From: Patrick Huber
Date: 13.02.2008

	If a filename starts with '/', glb_fopen will nonetheless try
	to prepend either the working directory from which the program
	is called or the path given by GLB_PATH. It will not first try
	the filename itself.

From: Christine Lewis

BUG #25 in glbShiftEnergyScale, for the case k==n_bins-1, the expression should
        read rates_out[i] = (1 + b) * (-rates_in[k] * (delta - k) + rates_in[k])
        (missing minus sign).

BUG #26 constants for GLB_KM_TO_EV conversion based on c=3E8 m/s,
    	fixed to correct value. Also GLB_V_FACTOR updated to reflect
    	the accurate CODATA based value for Sqrt(2) G_F/u (atomic mass
    	unit). Introduced GLB_OLD_CONSTANTS, which if defined at
    	compile time will switch back to the previous values for
    	compatibility purposes.

BUG #27 the GNULIB replacement for argp creates an error messages
    	about 'gets' being undefined. The fix is an obscure patch in
    	stdio.in.h inside the lib directory, which basically assumes
    	that we deal with some sort of a reasonable operating system,
    	i.e. there will some appropriate version of gets somewhere.
