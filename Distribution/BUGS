BUG#1 final_clean sometimes produces SEGFAULT

From: Patrick Huber
Date: 19.07.04

	On some occasions final_clean produces a SEGFAULT. This happens
	when the program exits after some fatal parse errors, since
	then some pointers are not correctly setup by glb_default_expirment
	(it is never called). Then the call of glbFreeExp produces a
	SEGFAULT in the attempt to free one of the SignalRates pointers
	in one of the experiment structures. The problem may have its roots in
	copy_buff in the parser.
