This file contains the list of features, some of were proposed by users, to be
added. 

TODO ABSOLUTELY :
-----------------

* It will be cool to add a verbosity level controlling the level of progress
  report. 

* It will be cool to warn use of not defined #instructions.

* Maybe I should debianize all the stuff.

TODO EVENTUALLY (I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT OTHER SOLUTIONS BEFORE) :
----------------------------------------------------------------

* Import netscape bookmarks (folder or files).

End of TODO.
