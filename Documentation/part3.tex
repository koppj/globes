~\\
=================================\\
This is a very raw version of the modules part, it is not clear
wether it will be an own part or just a chapter somewhere else.
In any case it should serve a reference in using modules in
Version 2.1\\
=================================\\


The ability of \GLOBES\ to use dynamically loadable modules makes it easy
to extend the functionality of \GLOBES\ at run-time and to adapt it to
new tasks in a transparent way. This part of the manual describes how 
modules are used, how they are written and compiled. Also some details
on static linking of modules will be discussed.
