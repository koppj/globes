Simulation of long-baseline neutrino oscillation
experiments with GLoBES

We present the GLoBES (``General Long Baseline Experiment Simulator'')
software package, which allows the simulation of long-baseline and reactor
neutrino oscillation experiments. One part of the software is the
abstract experiment definition language to define experiments with
beam and full detector descriptions as accurate as possible. Many 
systematics options are provided, such as normalization and energy
calibration errors, or the choice between spectral or total rate 
information. For the 
definition of experiments, a new transparent building block concept is 
introduced. In addition, an additional program provides the possibility 
to develop and test new experiment definitions quickly.
Another part of GLoBES is the user's interface, which provides 
probability, rate, and $\Delta \chi^2$ information for a given experiment 
or any combination of up to 32 experiments in C. Especially, the
$\Delta \chi^2$ functions allow a simulation with statistics only,
systematics, correlations, and degeneracies. In particular, GLoBES
can handle the full multi-parameter correlation among the oscillation
parameters, external input, and matter density uncertainties.
