Here comes how to load and modify existing experiments;
also: how does the main screen work and the most important functions at exampled

\chapter{Features of the \EDM }

\section{Source properties}

\section{Oscillation properties}

\section{Detector properties}

\chapter{Creating new experiments}

Most advanced step: How to create a new experiment from scratch.
