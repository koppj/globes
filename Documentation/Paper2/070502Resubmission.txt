Dear Editor,

we are very pleased about the two very positive referee reports. 
Hereby we submit the revised version of our manuscript. 

Reviewer (1) argues that Equ. (8) is not consistent with the usual 
chi2 definition (see Particle Data Group). Though there are no 
substantial effects in most cases, the referee is correct that in 
some cases (especially with low event rates) there could be differences. 
We changed Eqs. (8) and (10) accordingly, as the referee suggests. 
In addition, we have changed the software starting with version 3.0.8 
and higher to be consistent with this chi2 definition.

About the editorial comments: 

We have changed the BibTeX bib-style file to h-elsevier.bst. We hope that
the references are now compatible with your style. If not, please
send us the appropriate bst-file.

We would like to submit GLoBES version 3.0.8 to the program library. Installation 
instructions can be found in Appendix A of your manual. Any other questions 
should be answered by the very first chapter ``What is GLoBES?'' of the manual. 
Since GLoBES is changing dynamically, we would like to ask you to link the 
official GLoBES webpage to the program library:
http://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/lin/globes/index.html
We will send these files to the editor Dr. Scott directly.

We hope that our manuscript is now suitable for publication in CPC.

Best regards,

Walter Winter (on behalf of the authors)
